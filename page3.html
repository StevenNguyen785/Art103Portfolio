          <center><b>1. Question:</center> What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?
        <p></p>
        <div></b>
          <center><b>Answer:</b></center> A system consist a type of mapping network which must reach the requirements of being structured and organized. A working system can either be a group of people working together or a map of outlet mall for
          visitors and customers. If the system is currently operational or functional, it is considered a “working” system. An example of what a working system is not, which is that it does not have or lacks details of how the supposed system
          operates. Another example is for a group to be considered a system, it needs to consistently stay functional and serves a purpose.</p>
        </div>
    </center>
    <div>
      <p>
        <center><b>2. Question:</center> For the 4 system definition you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</b></center>
      <p></p>
      <b>
        <center>Answers:</center>
      </b>
      <center><b>Modularity</b></center> is a versatile system which can be either organic or in-organic beings. This versatile system is supposed to be anti-complex to point where it can change and interchange into multiple systems independently
      which can serve different purposes. An example of modularity if the system is a non-organic object, then an AA battery has the ability and purpose to give power to not just one but to multiple different devices.<p></p>
      <center><b>Decomposibility</b></center>
      <center>is where a single living thing or an object breaks down into individual more simple equal components. In other terms, decomposibility can multiply if the parts are equal from the source of the original component. An example of
        decomposibility is a decaying corpse or a rotting animal where the molecular system of a living thing is no longer functional and is its cells are broken down.<p></p>
        <center><b>Emergence</center></b> is a type of a complex system which two different properties have intersected and turns both into one task working whole. Basically, it is a type of philosophy where if the two different properties are
        separate and have not
        emerged yet, they can not complete the task on their own. For example, for someone to be avid gamer they must interact with video games because the two properties which are the gamer and video games can not become a game by themselves,
        therefore they need to emerge.<p></p>
      </center>
    </div>
    <center><b>Chaos Theory</b></center>
    <center>is a complete randomness in which it is an opposite term of the synonym language. This theory is a complex system where it does not have a straightforward distinct structure or pattern. The result of a chaos
      theory can be unpredictable because even though the chaos theory has a statement of reason why it exists the end result of it is not 100% approximate. For example, in a non-natural system, winning a lottery ticket is unpredictable and is not
      structured because the end result is not approximate because the probability of anyone winning is very complex. </center>
    </p>
    <p>
      <center><b>3. Question:</center></b>
      <center><b>Give us your definition of what Tesslation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.</center></b>
    <p></p>
    <center><b>Answer:</center></b> Tesslation is a repeating pattern of several geometric or a nongeometric shapes which are tiling and has no open spaces, nor it is overlapping from one another. An example of a Tesslation that I encountered several
    times in the past are
    artistic tesslation of carpets and rugs. The types of carpet or rugs that I encountered has symmetrical patterns within it because it has geometric shapes that is being repeated all over its fabric.</p>
    <p>
      <center><b>4. Question:</center></b>
      <center><b>What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?</center></b>
    <p></p>
    <center><b>Answer:</center></b> The main difference in ideas between these two terms are that Modularity has a versatile system where independent components of that system can work on their own. When it comes to Tesselation, its almost the
    opposite of modularity. The
    patterns of this type of artistry needs all the shapes in a way need to work together to make a repetitive motion within the planes of tiles. The two or more properties of modularity can be just about anything if it serves a purpose once the
    properties are one whole. The properties of Tesselation consist of mathematics and fundamentals of tiling.</p>
    <p>
      <center><b>5. Question:</center></b>
      <center><b>What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)?</center></b>
    <p></p>
    <center><b>Answer:</center></b> Aperiodic is a type of task that can very random or like a chaos theory where the result of the task can be unpredictable. Also, aperiodic at times can be sporadic. The characteristics of periodic task are the
    opposite of aperiodic
    where designing something is very linear. Also, the timed or time intervals for the Uniformed periodic task of designing are very fixed.</p>
